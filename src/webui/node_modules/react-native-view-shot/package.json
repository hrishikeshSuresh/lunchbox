Capture the view once at mount. (It is important to understand image loading won't be waited, in such case you want to use `\"none\"` with `viewShotRef.capture()` after `Image#onLoad`.)\n  - `\"continuous\"` EXPERIMENTAL, this will capture A LOT of images continuously. For very specific use-cases.\n  - `\"update\"` EXPERIMENTAL, this will capture images each time React redraw (on did update). For very specific use-cases.\n- **`onCapture`**: when a `captureMode` is defined, this callback will be called with the capture result.\n- **`onCaptureFailure`**: when a `captureMode` is defined, this callback will be called when a capture fails.\n\n## `captureRef(view, options)` lower level imperative API\n\n```js\nimport { captureRef } from \"react-native-view-shot\";\n\ncaptureRef(viewRef, {\n  format: \"jpg\",\n  quality: 0.8\n})\n.then(\n  uri => console.log(\"Image saved to\", uri),\n  error => console.error(\"Oops, snapshot failed\", error)\n);\n```\n\nReturns a Promise of the image URI.\n\n- **`view`** is a reference to a React Native component.\n- **`options`** may include:\n  - **`width`** / **`height`** *(number)*: the width and height of the final image (resized from the View bound. don't provide it if you want the original pixel size).\n  - **`format`** *(string)*: either `png` or `jpg` or `webm` (Android). Defaults to `png`.\n  - **`quality`** *(number)*: the quality. 0.0 - 1.0 (default). (only available on lossy formats like jpg)\n  - **`result`** *(string)*, the method you want to use to save the snapshot, one of:\n    - `\"tmpfile\"` (default): save to a temporary file *(that will only exist for as long as the app is running)*.\n    - `\"base64\"`: encode as base64 and returns the raw string. Use only with small images as this may result of lags (the string is sent over the bridge). *N.B. This is not a data uri, use `data-uri` instead*.\n    - `\"data-uri\"`: same as `base64` but also includes the [Data URI scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme) header.\n  - **`snapshotContentContainer`** *(bool)*: if true and when view is a ScrollView, the \"content container\" height will be evaluated instead of the container height.\n\n## `releaseCapture(uri)`\n\nThis method release a previously captured `uri`. For tmpfile it will clean them out, for other result types it just won't do anything.\n\nNB: the tmpfile captures are automatically cleaned out after the app closes, so you might not have to worry about this unless advanced usecases. The `ViewShot` component will use it each time you capture more than once (useful for continuous capture to not leak files).\n\n## `captureScreen()` Android and iOS Only\n\n```js\nimport { captureScreen } from \"react-native-view-shot\";\n\ncaptureScreen({\n  format: \"jpg\",\n  quality: 0.8\n})\n.then(\n  uri => console.log(\"Image saved to\", uri),\n  error => console.error(\"Oops, snapshot failed\", error)\n);\n```\n\nThis method will capture the contents of the currently displayed screen as a native hardware screenshot. It does not require a ref input, as it does not work at the view level. This means that ScrollViews will not be captured in their entirety - only the portions currently visible to the user. \n\nReturns a Promise of the image URI.\n\n- **`options`**: the same options as in `captureRef` method.\n\n### Advanced Examples\n\n[Checkout react-native-view-shot-example](example)\n\n## Interoperability Table\n\n> Snapshots are not guaranteed to be pixel perfect. It also depends on the platform. Here is some difference we have noticed and how to workaround.\n\nModel tested: iPhone 6 (iOS), Nexus 5 (Android).\n\n| System             | iOS                | Android           | Windows           |\n|--------------------|--------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| View,Text,Image,.. | YES                | YES               | YES               |                    \n| WebView            | YES                | YES<sup>1</sup>   | YES               |\n| gl-react v2        | YES                | NO<sup>2</sup>    | NO<sup>3</sup>    |\n| react-native-video | NO                 | NO                | NO                |\n| react-native-maps  | YES                | NO<sup>4</sup>    | NO<sup>3</sup>    |\n| react-native-svg   | YES                | YES               | maybe?            |\n| react-native-camera   | NO                | YES               | NO <sup>3</sup>        |\n\n>\n1. Only supported by wrapping a `<View collapsable={false}>` parent and snapshotting it.\n2. It returns an empty image (not a failure Promise).\n3. Component itself lacks platform support.\n4. But you can just use the react-native-maps snapshot function: https://github.com/airbnb/react-native-maps#take-snapshot-of-map\n\n## Performance Optimization\n\nDuring profiling captured several things that influence on performance:\n1) (de-)allocation of memory for bitmap\n2) (de-)allocation of memory for Base64 output buffer\n3) compression of bitmap to different image formats: PNG, JPG\n\nTo solve that in code introduced several new approaches:\n- reusable images, that reduce load on GC;\n- reusable arrays/buffers that also reduce load on GC;\n- RAW image format for avoiding expensive compression;\n- ZIP deflate compression for RAW data, that works faster in compare to `Bitmap.compress`\n\nmore details and code snippet are below.\n\n### RAW Images\n\nIntroduced a new image format RAW. it correspond a ARGB array of pixels.\n\nAdvantages:\n- no compression, so its supper quick. Screenshot taking is less than 16ms;\n\nRAW format supported for `zip-base64`, `base64` and `tmpfile` result types.\n\nRAW file on disk saved in format: `${width}:${height}|${base64}` string.\n\n### zip-base64\n\nIn compare to BASE64 result string this format fast try to apply zip/deflate compression on screenshot results\nand only after that convert results to base64 string. In combination zip-base64 + raw we got a super fast\napproach for capturing screen views and deliver them to the react side.\n\n### How to work with zip-base64 and RAW format?\n\n```js\nconst fs = require('fs')\nconst zlib = require('zlib')\nconst PNG = require('pngjs').PNG\nconst Buffer = require('buffer').Buffer\n\nconst format = Platform.OS === 'android' ? 'raw' : 'png'\nconst result = Platform.OS === 'android' ? 'zip-base64' : 'base64'\n\ncaptureRef(this.ref, { result, format }).then(data => {\n    // expected pattern 'width:height|', example: '1080:1731|'\n    const resolution = /^(\\d+):(\\d+)\\|/g.exec(data)\n    const width = (resolution || ['', 0, 0])[1]\n    const height = (resolution || ['', 0, 0])[2]\n    const base64 = data.substr((resolution || [''])[0].length || 0)\n\n    // convert from base64 to Buffer\n    const buffer = Buffer.from(base64, 'base64')\n    // un-compress data\n    const inflated = zlib.inflateSync(buffer)\n    // compose PNG\n    const png = new PNG({ width, height })\n    png.data = inflated\n    const pngData = PNG.sync.write(png)\n    // save composed PNG\n    fs.writeFileSync(output, pngData)\n})\n```\n\nKeep in mind that packaging PNG data is a CPU consuming operation as a `zlib.inflate`.\n\nHint: use `process.fork()` approach for converting raw data into PNGs.\n\n> Note: code is tested in large commercial project.\n\n> Note #2: Don't forget to add packages into your project:\n> ```js\n> yarn add pngjs\n> yarn add zlib\n> ```\n\n## Troubleshooting / FAQ\n\n### Saving to a file?\n\n- If you want to save the snapshotted image result to the CameraRoll, just use https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/cameraroll.html#savetocameraroll\n- If you want to save it to an arbitrary file path, use something like https://github.com/itinance/react-native-fs\n- For any more advanced needs, you can write your own (or find another) native module that would solve your use-case.\n\n### The snapshot is rejected with an error?\n\n- Support of special components like Video / GL views is not guaranteed to work. In case of failure, the `captureRef` promise gets rejected (the library won't crash).\n\n### get a black or blank result or still have an error with simple views?\n\nCheck the **Interoperability Table** above. Some special components are unfortunately not supported. If you have a View that contains one of an unsupported component, the whole snapshot might be compromised as well.\n\n### black background instead of transparency / weird border appear around texts?\n\n- It's preferable to **use a background color on the view you rasterize** to avoid transparent pixels and potential weirdness that some border appear around texts.\n\n### on Android, getting \"Trying to resolve view with tag '{tagID}' which doesn't exist\"\n\n> you need to make sure `collapsable` is set to `false` if you want to snapshot a **View**. Some content might even need to be wrapped into such `<View collapsable={false}>` to actually make them snapshotable! Otherwise that view won't reflect any UI View. ([found by @gaguirre](https://github.com/gre/react-native-view-shot/issues/7#issuecomment-245302844))\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `ViewShot` component that will have `collapsable={false}` set to solve this problem.\n\n### Getting \"The content size must not be zero or negative.\"\n\n> Make sure you don't snapshot instantly, you need to wait at least there is a first `onLayout` event, or after a timeout, otherwise the View might not be ready yet. (It should also be safe to just wait Image `onLoad` if you have one). If you still have the problem, make sure your view actually have a width and height > 0.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `ViewShot` component that will wait the first `onLayout`.\n\n### Snapshotted image does not match my width and height but is twice/3-times bigger\n\nThis is because the snapshot image result is in real pixel size where the width/height defined in a React Native style are defined in \"point\" unit. You might want to set width and height option to force a resize. (might affect image quality)\n\n\n---\n\n## Thanks\n\n- To initial iOS work done by @jsierles in https://github.com/jsierles/react-native-view-snapshot\n- To React Native implementation of takeSnapshot in iOS by @nicklockwood\n- To Windows implementation by @ryanlntn\n",
